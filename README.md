# codecademy
This project is to build simple codecademy 

# Backend
The Backend Side is using Django framework with Django rest Framework

First please install virtual environment python, and then move into folder server and install all the dependencies package in file requirement.txt using command 
> pip install -r requirement.txt

We don't need to setup the database because the sqlite3 is already in the folder backend side.

Finally you can try to run server using runserver
>python manage.py runserver

Then you can check in the localhost:8000, (should have use port 8000 because the url api set in the frontend are using port 8000).

# Setup Frontend Side
For frontend side you can move into folder client-side. And then you can install all node_modules package dependencies react js using npm or yarn. 

you can use npm install
>npm install
>
>npm start
